# Spatially adaptive surveys for hotspot detection

This repository contains code accompyaning a simulation study of spatially adaptive survey design for disease hotspot detection. The script `run_cycle_script.r` is the highest level and calls on functions contained in the other files. 

The `visualize_results` script can be used to recreate the figures contained in our manuscript as well as generate other figures.
